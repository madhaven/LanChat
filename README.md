# LanChat

so this program is intended for communicating with the systems in a LAN/WLAN connection.
It uses socket programming done in python to connect to each other.
The server must be selected first... followed by clients

the LanChat.py file is a CLI version of the project and is pretty neat for all its worth.
the LanChat.pyw file is still under construction. Although it could be used pretty fine either way as of now.
